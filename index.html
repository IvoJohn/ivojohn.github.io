								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>Hi!, my name is Ivo John. I am a fifth year Medicine student on Warsaw University of Medicine and final year student of 
									Mechatronics with English as a lecture language on Warsaw University of Technology.</p>
								<p>I am interested in Deep Learning in Medical applications and all things you can see on this page I have learned myself. </p>
								<p>	During my everyday classes in Warsaw's hospitals I still can observe plenty of room for improvement in the field of technologies applied in medicine.
									This motivates me to read and learn about what can be done in both distant future and tomorrow. Thanks to my engineering studies
									I have also a background in math or physics to better understand those applications and due to my interest in this subjects I can expand
									this knowledge and build up neccessary skills.
								</p>
								<p>
									Apart from my educations and technical interests I also spend my free time in the gym training powerlifting. Moreover
									I try to be in touch with the general knowledge and also read things outside textbooks.

							<h2 class="major">Time series analysis</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-intro.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Abstract</h3>
							<p>In this project I performed analysis and plotting of a time series of energy consumption. Data was obtained 
								from hourly measurements of energy consumption done by PJM Interconnection and published on kaggle. <br/>
								I explored and plotted the data with interactive plots done in matplotlib and then process them to a form suitable for network input.
								I tried different approaches, from the simplest, one neuron network to combination of 2D CNN with LSTM. The best prediction obtained
								 mean squared error of 6.2e-5.</p>

							<h3>Data exploration</h3>
							<p>
								The data is consisted of a single feature time-series registered every hour. The registered value is an energy consumption in megawats.
								There are no missing values and the total amount of them is equal to 145 366. The beginning of measurements is 01.01.2002 01:00 and the end is
								03.08.2018 00:00.
								The mean value of energy consumption is 32080.22MW, standard deviation is 6464.01MW, minimal value is 14544.0MW, maximal value is 62009.0MW
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-2.png" alt="" /></span>
								Above we can see histogram with 20-bins. The population is right-skewed. Below there is a box plot showing both the trend and seasonality 
								of the data. There is no observable trend in the data but there is a visible seasonality on the yearly-basis. After the closer inspection we 
								can also observe sesonality on the daily-basis. In the code there is more plots and the one below is interactive, enabling to show
								seasonality during year, week and day of the week with possibility of choosing any avaiable day and year.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-3.png" alt="" /></span>
								In the code there is also a plot for multiplicative and additive decomposition.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-4.png" alt="" /></span>
								Above we have a plot of moving average with window set to 31 days. This plot is also interactive, with possibility to change the size
								of the window from 10 to 88 days. With the plot above we can also observe clear seasonality of the data.
							</p>
							<h3>Data preparation</h3>
							<p>
								In this step I prepared the data to suit the format needed by neural networks architectures. Buf before that I check the stationarity
								of the data. This was done with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.<br/>
								Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is a type of unit root test which performs autoregression with the null hypothesis of a time-series
								being non-stationary. The P-value of this test was equal to 2.02e-30 which is way below the threshold value of 5% so I abondoned further
								processing data to eliminate its non-stationarity since it was virtualy non-existing.
								The data was divided into training, validation and test sets, scalled with a scaller fitted only to training data to avoid
								lekage of any information to validation and test sets and as the last step splitted into X and y with window size of 30 and shift of 1.
								Sequence length was set to 20.
							</p>
							<h3>Forecasting</h3>
							<p>
								<h5>Single layer model</h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-5.png" alt="" /></span>
								As the reference point I started from simples possible model, with only one layer and one neuron. Due to small computational cost
								I decided to find the most optimal learning rate with Learning Rate Scheduler and plot of learning rate vs epoch. The most optimal value
								was equal to 2e-3 so it was set as the learning rate for a Adam optimizer in the final model. I used Huber loss as it is more resistant
								to outliers (like the one presented in data, which corresponds to the hurracane which takes place during the measurement period, resulting
								in decreass of energy consumption) and as a metric I set Mean Standard Error. The model was trained for 120 epochs and still have not reached
								platau nor the validation loss started increasing or fluctuating. This shows that the model could be trained even longer.
								The Mean Squared Error calculated on previously unseen test set was equal to 3.77e-4.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-6.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5>Multi layer model</h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-7.png" alt="" /></span>
								The next model was still composed of only fully connected layers But this time I applied many more neurons to each of the layers
								and also added Dropout equal to 20% between each of them. The model clearly overfitted which is visible both on the discrapency 
								of values between train loss and validation loss and also on the plots. This could be prevented with fewer layers (so simpler model)
								or with bigger dropout value between layers. The value of MSE on test set was equal to 1e-3.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-8.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5>LSTM</h5>
								Since we are dealing with time series, the most succesful architecture should be the one designed to learn from time data. 
								And that was the case. The applied network was constructed from two unilateral LSTM layers, one dense layer with relu activation
								and dropout of 20% before the output layer.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-9.png" alt="" /></span>
								I trained the network for 50 epochs and still did not reach plateau. But the most prominent fact was that the validation loss was
								a full order of magnitude smaller than training loss which clearly shows lack of overfitting, probably even bigger model could be used
								to this data.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-10.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-11.png" alt="" /></span>
								Also the value of MSE on test set was the smalles among applied architectures: 6.2e-5.<br/><br/>
								<h5>LSTM with Convolution</h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-12.png" alt="" /></span>
								This architecture turned out to be the worst among applied ones. After training for 50 epochs it clearly overfitted the data with 
								training loss an order of magnitute smaller than in the case of only LSTM layers and the value of validation loss was on the contrary
								order of magnitute bigger.
								The value of MSE on test data was the worst and equal to 1.3e-3.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timeseries-13.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h5>Discussion</h5>
								The most effective network in this case turned out to be the one constructed with two LSTM layers, the quality of predictions was
								high. It could be even higher if the network would be trained for a longer time or maybe slightly bigger. The application of a correct
								architecture enables to reduce the Mean Squared Error on previously unseen test set by the two orders of magnitude.
								Another approaches which could be applied would be forecasting the data after removing sesonality or with other recurrent architectures.

							<h2 class="major">Chest X-ray classification</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/xray-0.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Abstract</h3>
							<p>In this project I used two convolutional neural networks to detect pneumonia on chest x-rays. The accuracy on training set
								exceeded 96%. The working networks were placed inside graphical user interface made with PyQt5. The interface provides easy
								and intuitlional way of interacting with backend networks.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Interface</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/xray-1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The main functionality of the program is provided after uploading image with a button opening file menager.
								The first network is responsible for classifying if the uploaded image presents chest x-ray or not. In the letter case an error
								window shows up and asks for uplouding different image. If the image is correct the result of classification with assigned
								certainty of it is shown.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/xray-3.png" alt="" /></span>
								Apart from classifying images the interface offers possibility to read the short documentation of the backend solutions and
								to remaind oneselfs that this is not anything close to a clinicaly ready solution. Both pieces of information are avaiable after
								clicking on a designeted buttons.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/xray-2.png" alt="" /></span>
							</p>
							
							<h3>Backend</h3>
							<p>
								The networks which provides core functionality of the program were written in Tensorflow with Keras. Both of them have 
								the same architecture with pretrained VGG16 followed by Flatten layer, two dropouts and two Dense layers. The usage of 
								pretrained network exceeded all other applied approaches and reached over 93% of accuracy as early as in the second epoch.
								The network classifying non-pneumonia vs pneumonia images was trained for 15 epochs. The network classifying presence of 
								a chest x-ray on the uploaded image was trained for only one epochs due to custom callback which interupted training
								after exceeding 97% of accuracy.
								In both cases image data generators were used to provide more variability in the training set. In the case of pneumonia detection
								the augmentation was rather small due to the assumption that x-ray images have a standarized procedure of performing and there
								should not be a big variance between their rotation etc.
								Also in the case of pneumonia detection I applied weights to the classes since the number of positive examples was almost three
								times larger. Due to only two classes weights were calculated by hand, without usage of scikit-learn tools.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/xray-4.png" alt="" /></span>
							</p>

							<h3>Further development</h3>
							<p>
								The further developement of the project could include adding another classes to distingish between, like separating bacterial
								from viral pneumonia, or lobar from intersitial pneumonia. Another functionality could be visualisation of convolutional filters
								activation in the network. Probably the most interesing solution would be an automatic description generator, but this is limited
								by the amount of data avaiable.
